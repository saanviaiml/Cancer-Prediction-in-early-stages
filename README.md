# Cancer Prediction in early stages

Dataset Overview: The dataset contains information on various factors potentially related to cancer risk across 1000 patients.

Data Cleaning: Initial cleaning involved dropping the 'Patient Id' column and converting categorical labels in 'Level' to numerical values for analysis.

Data Integrity: No missing values were found in any of the columns, ensuring data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations including heatmap and countplots were used to explore distributions and relationships between variables like smoking habits and chest pain frequency.

Statistical Insights: Boxplots revealed insights such as age distributions across different chest pain levels and smoking habits.

Age and Smoking Trends: Analyzing age groups showed varying smoking prevalence, with peaks observed in specific age brackets like around 33 years.

Visualization: Heatmap and countplots provided visual clarity on the dataset's attributes and distributions, highlighting correlations and frequency distributions.

Insight into Risk Factors: The dataset highlighted factors like occupational hazards and genetic risks, influencing cancer prediction levels.

Prediction Levels: Levels were categorized into low and high risk based on data attributes like pollution exposure and genetic predispositions.

Conclusion: This analysis aids in understanding potential risk factors for cancer and provides insights for further predictive modeling and healthcare applications.
